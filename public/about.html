<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>What is more pleasure than seeing your new application running the way you were thinking and dreaming about it? 
  What makes a developer happy more than a hard strange but fixed at last bug?
</p>

<p>
  After graduating from Faculty of Computer Science (FCIS) in Ain Shams University, I worked as a .Net software developer for more than 2 years. 
  My studies in the faculty and the experience I gained from working on .Net applications strengthened my ability to write clean code and deeply understand object oriented concepts.

  After taking time to study new technologies and recall what I have learned after some time away from the programming field. I am now working as a freelancer web developer after earning the Professional and Advanced Web Development Nano degrees from Udacity.
  (Work more to learn more) I totally believe in this quote. Nothing can make you deep learn a technology more than working with it.

<p> Apart from my passion in coding, programming and learning more, I like to read in my free time and also I like to make threads handicrafts like (Crochet and Embroidery). These hobbies help to increase my patience and search for perfection.
